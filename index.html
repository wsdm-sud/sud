            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p class="description">
            Verbal communication in the form of spoken dialogues is the most natural and prevalent medium of information exchange between humans. 
              Meetings, prevalent in enterprise environments, are a common communication channel to reach the collective agreements on decision making. 
              Another useful application area of analysis of conversational dialogues is the customer care, where a customer usually interacts with a 
              human or an automated agent (a chatbot) to work towards a specific task. e.g. troubleshoot a Linux workstation etc. 


              <!--A variety of automated processing on the transcripts of these conversational dialogues can be useful in practice, e.g., identification 
              of action items from meetings (specifically, the alternatives discussed and the criteria for each alternative) can help develop effective 
              decision making support systems in enterprises as well as in end-user scenarios. Moreover, applications of NLP and IR methodologies in 
              dialogue based interactive systems, e.g. the need to summarize the meetings, allow provision for ad hoc search on meetings effectively 
              indexing these meetings so that they can be retrieved has increasingly drawn attention from the research community-->.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="description">
            There are several open problems in this domain that require an in-depth research such as understanding the <b>nature of conversations</b>, their <b>underlying intent</b> and <b>evaluating</b> the quality of new <b>conversational search tools/algorithms</b>.
            The workshop aims to accomplish the following two goals.
            <ol>
            <li>Gather researchers from the IR and NLP communities to present their recent work on the topic and
            <li>Provide a platform for new PhD students or early researchers to build and evaluate conversational systems on labeled data.
            </ol>

            </p>
            <p>
            The first objective of the proposed <b>SUD workshop series</b> is to bring together researchers from diverse fields â€“ Information Retrieval, Data Mining and Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Human Computer Interaction etc. to further advance the state of research in applications and impact of information retrieval to digital two-party or multi-party text or multi-modal dialogues. Given the diverse audience, participants and program of WSDM, it would be an ideal venue to advance research on such topics.

            </p>
            <p>The second objective is to invite PhD students and new researchers to conduct research on an open dataset and discuss their findings with experts at the workshop. We specifically encourage research on a recently released dataset containing conversations extracted from movies, labeled with entities of interest and wikipedia passages relevant to the corresponding entities that add more context. The dataset, released as part of <a href='https://rcd2020firetask.github.io/RCD2020FIRETASK/' target="_blank">RCD Track at FIRE 2020</a>, aims to explore the utility of IR systems to fetch more information about entities discussed in these dialogues.</p>
            <!--p>
            It has been established that IR systems can be used to retrieve relevant information either to generate replies in conversations or to add more context about a particular topic during an interactive dialogue between two entities. In addition to inviting work on
            <b>conversational IR </b> and <b>conversational assistive technologies</b>, we specifically focus on an interesting and timely research question that we seek to address as a part of our
data challenge track.
While the regular track invites submissions on both the understanding on and the supporting of conversational dialogues, the data challenge track specifically focuses on the latter. In particular, in order to support conversational dialogues we explore the utility of IR systems to retrieve more information about entities discussed in interactive dialogues. As a continuation of our shared task - RCD1(Retrieval from Conversational Dialogues) organized at FIRE 2020, a large dataset of conversations annotated with underlying user intent is made available. Participants will thus be invited to develop methods for solving practical challenges on the dataset which include detecting user intent in dialogues and retrieving useful information to support these intents.

      <h1> Research track call for papers</h1> 
        The proposed workshop will consist of two tracks a) Research track and b) Data challenge track. 
        Research paper track invites submissions from themes and topics aligned with research in Conversational Dialogues. 

        The following topics associated with Intelligent Assistants are particularly of interest for SUD 2021 workshop:

        <!--li>Task-driven search</li>
        <ul><li>Zero-query</li> <li> Implicit search </li> </ul-->
        </ul>

        <!--For authors whose work hasn't been accepted in the main conference, this is a good chance for them to reshape their work and send it to this workshop
        so as to foster discussions on this emerging topic.
        For authors whose papers have already been accepted in the WSDM main conference, they could submit a new work-in-progress
        aligned with their paper in the main conference. -->

          <h1> Data Challenge Track</h1> 
           <p>The data challenge track is a continuation of our effort to investigate the research question of contextualization of conversational 
           dialogues. A shared task was recently organized - <b>Retrieval from Conversational Dialogues (<a href="https://rcd2020firetask.github.io/RCD2020FIRETASK/" target="_blank">RCD</a>) </b> at FIRE 2020.
            </p>
                Data challenge track seeks submissions that investigate both understanding of sample dialogues and support such conversations with more contextual information. 
                As part of the challenge, we are releasing conversational data for <a href='https://rcd2020firetask.github.io/RCD2020FIRETASK/#services' target="_blank">two tasks</a>. The first task is to detect entities in these conversations. The second task is to retrieve informative content about these 
                entities to facilitate user understanding. Although prior work has looked into contextualizing short documents, such as 
                tweets, the proposed data challenge track requires contextualizing aspects of a conversation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Papers submitted to this track <b>must</b> report at least one experiment with the <a href="https://rcd2020firetask.github.io/RCD2020FIRETASK/#dataset" target="_blank">dataset released as a part of the RCD track</a>. Authors are encouraged to either
            experiment and report results for the two RCD tasks - that of detecting entities in the text spans from movie dialogues or of retrieving relevant information given a dialog context, or reporting experiments on <b>novel tasks on this dataset</b>.
